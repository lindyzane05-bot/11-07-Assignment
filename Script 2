# Variables and Data Types: Define the number of sides and possible successful rolls
dice_sides = 6        # Integer
successful_rolls = 6  # (1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1)
total_outcomes = dice_sides * dice_sides # Operator: Multiplication
probability = successful_rolls / total_outcomes # Operator: Division

# Input (Simulated): A question about a specific roll (not user input to stay brief)
# For the 10-line limit, we'll focus on the calculation and print.

# Print the result
print(f"Total possible dice rolls: {total_outcomes}")
