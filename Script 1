# --- Input/Given Values ---
# The total available study time in hours
total_time_hours = 4

hard_subject_percentage = 0.60

# Percentage of time to dedicate to the easiest subject (40% or 0.40)
easy_subject_percentage = 0.40

# --- Calculation ---
# Calculate the time for the hardest subject
time_for_hard = total_time_hours * hard_subject_percentage

# Calculate the time for the easiest subject
time_for_easy = total_time_hours * easy_subject_percentage

# --- Output ---
print(f"Total Study Time: {total_time_hours} hours\n")

print("📝 Study Schedule Split:")
# Format the output to two decimal places for clarity
print(f"Time for Hardest Subject (60%): **{time_for_hard:.2f} hours**")
print(f"Time for Easiest Subject (40%): **{time_for_easy:.2f} hours**")
